      <h1>Advantages of working with this template</h1>
      <p>
        Besides buying the template you need some basic web skills in order to
        customize it. Nothing too fancy HTML/CSS will do just fine and a little
        bit of image editing. You can always hire a web designer to help with
        the customization work while you provide the template and the content
        that is the most important.

        Riga is a landing page HTML template made with Bootstrap to help you
        showcase your mobile app online and persuade visitors to download it
        from the app stores. The author used Bootstrap to build the template and
        integrated a nice animated navigation that slides from outside the
        screen.
